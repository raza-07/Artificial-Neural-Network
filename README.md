# Artificial-Neural-Network
Hinton's classic 1986 Nature paper, presented in an Urdu vlog on YT, video explanation

The video will be an Urdu-language tutorial on neural networks, focusing on learning through backpropagation and weight adjustment using gradient descent. It will demonstrate how altering weights impacts the network’s output and, consequently, the cost function, aiming to minimize error and achieve outputs close to the target values. The process is iterative, with the formula (W(new)​=W(old)​+ΔW).
